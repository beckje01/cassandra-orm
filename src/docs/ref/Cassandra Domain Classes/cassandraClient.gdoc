h1. cassandraClient

This property references the client used to communicate with Cassandra.  As of this writing, the only client supported
is Astyanax, so this property returns the @astyanaxService@.  This property is convenient for implementing additional
cassandra-related queries within a domain class.  For example:

{code}
def logKey = "SOME_ROW_KEY"
def rows = cassandraClient.keyspace().prepareQuery("LogData")
        .getRow(logKey)
        .execute()
        .result
{code}
