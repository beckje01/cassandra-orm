The Cassandra ORM Plugin provides GORM-like dynamic methods for persisting Groovy objects into Cassandra.  The plugin
does not implement the GORM API but does generally follow the same syntax.  In addition to the GORM extensions, the
plugins extends java.util.UUID with methods to generate and use TimeUUIDs, which often server as primary keys in
Cassandra.
