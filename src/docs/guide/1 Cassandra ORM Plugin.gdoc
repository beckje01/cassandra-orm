The Cassandra ORM Plugin provides GORM-like dynamic methods for persisting Groovy objects into Cassandra.  The plugin
does not implement the GORM API but generally follows the same syntax.  It also includes additional methods and options
that specifically suited to Cassandra. In addition to the dynamic persistence methods, the plugin extends java.util.UUID
with methods to generate and use TimeUUIDs, which often server as primary keys in Cassandra.
